# ARM optimization and verification

Updated 2026-10-17. The target is the Khadas VIM4 running 64-bit Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS. Native ARM64 CI uses Ubuntu 22.04; it is not a VIM4 hardware benchmark.

## First optimization pass

Release link-time optimization is available through `AEOLUS_ENABLE_IPO=ON` and enabled for ARM64 CI. CMake checks compiler/linker support and fails clearly if unavailable. The portable ARM64 baseline remains unchanged; no host-specific `-march=native`, fast-math, lower precision, voice reduction or shortened reverb is introduced.

Spatial block processing keeps the two ears' normalized biquad coefficients and recursive histories local, then commits history after the block. The original direct-form-I expression and delay-line operations remain. `tick` remains the independent sample-by-sample reference. This targets a hot path identified in the VIM4 handoff, but measured kernel speedup and actual hardware polyphony are separate results.

Tests compare block processing against `tick` over impulses, deterministic noise, silent tails, asymmetric positions, 44.1/48 kHz geometry, varied/zero block sizes, in-place/overlapping buffers, resets and transitions back to `tick`. They reject peak sample error of 1e-6 or greater and check that processing allocates/frees no C++ heap objects. Existing MIDI, voice-release and convolution regressions still run.

## Reproducible kernel measurement

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-arm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DAEOLUS_ENABLE_IPO=ON -DAEOLUS_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build-arm --parallel 2
xvfb-run -a ctest --test-dir build-arm --output-on-failure
xvfb-run -a build-arm/aeolus_tests --benchmark-spatial
```

The benchmark alternates reference and block processing order, warms both, uses 300 independent spatial sources with 64-frame blocks, consumes outputs, and reports median, p99 and worst elapsed microseconds. It is an offline spatial-kernel measurement, not a full-engine voice-capacity or callback-deadline result. Virtual-machine scheduling and a different ARM CPU can affect results. Run several times on the target board and inspect dispersion before accepting a performance claim.

## VIM4 comparison

Preserve the working display/touch configuration and existing organ files. Use the same organ, registration, notes/velocities, sample rate, 512-sample buffer and direct USB ALSA device for baseline and candidate. Confirm the current governor, cluster frequencies and thermal state; log them rather than silently changing the system. The handoff reports throttling, so uncontrolled sequential runs can obscure small changes.

Compare an unchanged build, an IPO-only build and the spatial candidate separately. Record uncapped callback median/p99/worst times and deadline misses/xruns, sustained voices, note-off/release behavior and reverb settings. Listen to repeatable passages and tails. The existing capped/smoothed audio meter and process CPU alone do not establish an improvement. Do not claim the handoff's observed polyphony as a new validated result.

The older VIM4 delay-index experiment is not imported: it reportedly gave little observable improvement and remains a local experiment on that machine. The GCC declaration correction is already in the repository. Convolution idle suspension, NEON kernels, multicore synthesis and algorithmic reverb remain separate work; none is implied by enabling IPO.
